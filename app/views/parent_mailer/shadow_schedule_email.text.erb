Dear <%= @parent.first_name.capitalize %>,

<%= @parent.students.first.first_name %> is confirmed to shadow on <%= @shadow_date_for_print %>.
The full shadow schedule is printed below. The teacher for this class is copied above if you have
any questions. I would be happy to meet with you at <%= @meeting_time %> just after classes get started and you
drop <%= @students.first.first_name %> off.

As a reminder, WEB meets at Dalewood UMC, 2300 Ridgecrest Drive. You will enter through the double
glass doors under the awning.

Should there be severe weather on your scheduled shadow day, please contact me at 615-496-9995 to
see if classes are meeting as planned.

============================================

Your <%= @parent.students.count > 1 ? "children's" : "child's" %> Shadow Schedule is below:

<% @parent.students.each do |s| %>
  Student: <%= s.full_name %>
  Grade: <%= s.grade %>
  <% if s.shadow_spots.empty? %>
  ** This student has not yet signed up to shadow **
  <% else %>
  Current shadow schedule:

    <% s.shadow_spots.each do |shadow_spot| %>
    Subject: <%= shadow_spot.subject.name %>
    Date:    <%= shadow_spot.date.strftime("%-m/%-d/%Y") %>
    Time:    <%= shadow_spot.time %>

    <% end %>
  -----------------------------
  <% end %>
<% end %>

I look forward to meeting you and <%= @students.first.first_name %>!
